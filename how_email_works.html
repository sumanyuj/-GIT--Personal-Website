    <p class="blog_body">So I just add my subject line, my recepients, and my body, and viola- Send!<br><br>

        But, how does email actually work- surley it's not "magic" or some "geeky wizardy".<br><br>
        
        
        Well, it's actually quite simple!<br><br>
        
        The user interfaces with an email client, such as gmail or yahoo, through a website. Users each have their own unique address. When the user composes their email, there are a few things of note:<br><br>
        
        To : used for main recipients of an email<br><br>
        
        CC (Carbon Copy) : used for secondary recipeients; they can still see the other recpients<br><br>
        
        BCC (Blind Carbon Copy): used by the sender to "blind" the recpeients from seeing each other<br><br>
        
        
        Other than that, the user simply hits sends, and this is where the fun begins!<br><br>
        
        1. The email client will communicate with YOUR own server using SMTP, which is the protocol for outgoing mail. <br>
        2. Your email server communicates with the intended target's server, through DNS (which finds IP) and perhaps several SMTP server through "hopping"<br>
        3. The email is then stored in a mailbox<br>
        4. The recipient does not get the mail directly to their device, unless they request to view it [like clicking on the mail in the app]<br><br>
