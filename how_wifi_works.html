        To understand WiFi, you should probbaly know the main components of it: A router, wireless access point (AP), the client devices, the modem, and the Internet Service Provider (ISP). All of these need to work in tandem for you to be able to stream YouTube and Netflix, for example.<br><br>

        <b>Router</b>: Acts as the central device for a WiFi network, and its job is to route the data between the devices and connect the local network to the big world wide internet. Think of the router as a traffic controller.<br><br>
        
        <b>Wirless Access Point (AP)</b>: Often integrated into the router, the main job of this guy is to broadcast the WiFi signal so that client devices have access to the network. This is done by broadcasting specific radio signals (usually 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands)<br><br>
        
        <b>Client Devices</b>: These gadgets recieve the connection from the router so that they can access the internet. They so this by having a built-in WiFi adpater or chips that will allow them to recieve and send data using radio frequencies (2.4 GHz and 5 GHz, usually)<br><br>
        
        <b>Modem</b>: Sometimes integerated with the router, or seperated, the modem acts as the gatekepper for the WiFi network to the lands of the internet. The router recieves data from the internet via this modem, and then sends it to the proper device over the network.<br><br>
        
        <b>Internet Service Porviders (ISPs)</b>: These players (such as Verizon and Spectrum) provide their customers with access to the internet. These ISPs have networks that are connected to the large internet infastructure, and they sell this access. They use an assortment of protocols and to route data (they have a vast network of switches and routers to manage this). They also assign your IP address, which is  necessary for devices to communicate over the internet. The Domain Name Services (DNS) are often provided by the ISP. Their purpose is to convert human-readable domain names (google.com) to IP addresses that a human can understand. <br><br>
